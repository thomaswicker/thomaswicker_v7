            A little about "work me"

            Currently working as a Principal UX Designer in Centennial, Colorado.

          <p class="body-text">
            I am a full stack designer based out of Denver, CO. Jumping into the Wayback Machine... I started off in early 2000 as a fine artist and abstract acrylic painter. After completing my Associates Degree, I quickly began pursuing a career in Graphic/Web Design at the Art Institute of Colorado focusing on the basics of user experience, color theory, layout, typography and more. This built the foundation for what was to become my true passion, UI/UX and software development.
          </p>

          <p class="body-text">
            Fast forward to present day, I now have over 15 years of hands-on real world experience in UI/UX design, rapid prototyping and front-end/mid-tier development. I have created websites and applications for a wide range of industries ranging from apparel to health care to the financial industry to oil and gas. I focus my attention on implementing sound design principles basing all of my decisions on a blend of user driven need and clean semantic code.
          </p>

          <p class="body-text">
            In 2005 I opened a small freelance design/development shop in Colorado. Through this business I entertain small and large contracts for companies around Denver and throughout the US. In the little spare time I seem to have these days... I develop personal software applications and work on open source projects.

          <h2>
            A little about "other me"
          </h2>

          <p class="body-text">
            Aside from all the work stuff... I am a father of two beautiful and healthy girls that keep me on my toes and my life well balanced and meaningful. I love spending every free moment I have with them reading, playing a game on XBOX/PS4, watching some TV, or just chilling out playing a game from our extensive board game collection.
          </p>

          <p class="body-text">
            I am an avid cook and love to experiment with different cuisines. I enjoy a good Texas Hold'em cash game in Vegas, being out on the golf course or cheering on the Broncos. I love to travel when time permits, traveling gives you perspective and inspires creativity.</span>
          </p>

          <p class="body-text">
            I also love to learn, learn and learn more... It's weird, but I can get just as much enjoyment out of studying the newest javascript framework or learning a foreign language than I do out of anything else. Life is a short ride and my motto is always be learning.

              Thomas is one of those front-end developers that every team hopes to have. He is artistic, can do design, responsive layouts, and UI/UX work. Additionally he knows javascript, ruby, haml, sass, and git. As a mid-tier developer, it was a pleasure to collaborate with Thomas.

              Thomas is truly a worker that loves his craft. I've seen him work harder than those hungry first year career employees, despite the fact that he has nothing to prove. I would highly recommend him in any role knowing fully that he will rise to the occasion, and enjoy every moment of it.

              RBSI initially hired Thomas for a 2 month project for some web related development we needed for one of our customers. Thomas did such an outstanding job for us that the assignment stretched to 7 months. We plan on using Thomas again on upcoming projects we have slated. Not only did Thomas do exceptionally good work for us - but he has a great attitude and interfaces extremely well with the end customer.

              Thomas is a detail oriented designer with great imagination. He is responsible for the majority of our custom CRM system look and feel redo and manages the UI/UX for just about every front end project here at Cricket. Thomas is such a valuable member of our contracting team that we are bringing him on full time here at Cricket. I would highly recommend Thomas for any UI/UX work.

              I had the pleasure of working with Thomas Wicker during my time with AT&T, formally Cricket Communications. I was brought on to Thomas's development team in late 2013 and with his guidance as team-lead we successfully delivered a robust, Enterprise User-Interface for Cricket Wireless. Thomas possessed excellent leadership skills as a project-manager, and as a colleague he was essential in excelling the project above and beyond the initial scope.
